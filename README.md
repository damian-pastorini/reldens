# [Reldens - MMORPG Platform](https://www.reldens.com/)

Welcome to Reldens, the MMORPG Platform designed to empower developers in creating multiplayer games.

With a wide array of features, Reldens enables developers to craft a rich gaming experience without grappling with the complexities usually associated with making a multiplayer game secure and efficient over any network.

Built with popular development tools such as NodeJS, Parcel, Colyseus, Phaser, and Firebase, integrated with various database engines, and following robust development practices, the platform ensures security, ease of use, and high customization for developers.

While the current stage of the platform is tailored for developers, ongoing improvements to the administration panel aim to make game creation accessible to non-developers in the future.
